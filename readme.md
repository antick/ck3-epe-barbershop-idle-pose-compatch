# EPE + Barbershop Idle Poses Compatch

**Updated for 1.7.2**

## Introduction

This mod fixes the Idle Poses compatibility with Fullscreen Barbershop and EPE (Ethnicities & Portraits expanded).

The below compatch is outdated so I had to create one myself. I can't imagine playing CK3 without this fix.
